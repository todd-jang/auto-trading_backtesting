# AI Global Stock Autotrading System

This project is a sophisticated simulation of an AI-powered, fully automated stock trading dashboard. It focuses on major global semiconductor stocks and demonstrates how different hedge fund strategies can be deployed based on real-time market analysis. The system is powered by the Google Gemini API to make high-level strategic decisions and generate trade signals.

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **Sophisticated Market Simulation**: Simulates a high-fidelity, real-time market feed for 6 major semiconductor stocks. The data is generated by a sophisticated model that emulates professional data feeds like **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)**, incorporating dynamic factors like trend, momentum, mean-reversion, and volatility for each stock individually. This provides a realistic testbed for the AI strategies.
-   **Real-time, Timezone-Aware Market Hours**: The simulation engine respects the actual trading hours of the relevant stock exchanges. It actively trades Korean stocks during KRX hours (09:00-15:30 KST) and US stocks during NYSE/NASDAQ hours (09:30-16:00 ET), providing a much more realistic trading environment.
-   **AI-Powered Engine**: Utilizes the Google Gemini API for multiple AI personas:
    -   **Chief Investment Officer (CIO)**: Analyzes the overall market regime (Trending, Ranging, etc.) and selects the most appropriate high-level hedge fund strategy.
    -   **Quantitative Analyst**: Analyzes individual stocks based on quantitative factors (Value, Momentum, etc.) within the CIO's strategic framework to generate BUY/SELL signals.
    -   **ML Inference Model**: Emulates a time-series machine learning model that uses technical features (RSI, price change, volatility) and a softmax probability output with a confidence threshold to make short-term predictions.
    -   **Sector-Aware Reasoning**: The Analyst AI's reasoning is enhanced with expert-defined industry context, leading to more nuanced trade decisions:
        -   **Memory Market**: For memory-related stocks (Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron), the AI considers market leadership weights in High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and general DRAM/NAND.
        -   **GPU Market**: For NVIDIA, the AI factors in its projected exclusive dominance for the next three years as a strong long-term bullish indicator.
        -   **Foundry Market**: For TSMC and Samsung, the AI uses market share data (TSMC: 80%, Samsung: 10%) to assess their competitive positioning and stability.
-   **Dynamic Hedge Fund Strategies**:
    -   **Alpha Momentum**: Capitalizes on trending markets.
    -   **Mean Reversion**: Trades on the expectation that prices will revert to their average.
    -   **Pairs Trading (Statistical Arbitrage)**: A market-neutral strategy that trades on the statistical relationship between two correlated stocks (e.g., Micron & SK Hynix).
    -   **Deep Hedging (ML)**: A machine-learning-driven approach for volatile or ranging markets.
    -   **Jocoding's Simple MA Cross**: A classic, rule-based strategy that buys on a "Golden Cross" (short-term MA crossing above long-term MA) and sells on a "Dead Cross".
    -   **Risk Off**: A safety-first mode that liquidates positions and holds cash.
-   **Comprehensive Portfolio Management**:
    -   Tracks cash and holdings across multiple currencies with real-time exchange rate application.
    -   Full support for **Long**, **Short**, and **Pairs Trade** positions.
    -   Virtual bank account for managing trading capital.
-   **Interactive Data Visualization**:
    -   Normalized performance chart to compare all stocks from a common baseline.
    -   Detailed candlestick charts for each individual stock.
    -   **Live trade markers** (‚ñ≤ for buy, ‚ñº for sell) plotted directly on the charts.
-   **Real-time Discord Notifications**: Pushes all AI trade decisions to a Discord channel via webhooks for instant monitoring.
-   **Modern UI/UX**:
    -   Sleek, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS.
    -   Includes both **Light and Dark modes**.
    -   Real-time logs for all AI decisions and trade activities.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This application is designed to run in a browser-based development environment where environment variables can be securely managed.

### Prerequisites

You need a Google Gemini API key to run this application.

### Setup

1.  **Environment Variable Configuration**:
    -   The application requires environment variables to function correctly. You must configure these in your deployment or development environment.
    -   **`API_KEY` (Required)**: Your Google Gemini API key.
    -   **`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` (Optional)**: To receive real-time trade alerts in a Discord channel, create a webhook in your Discord server settings and set the URL here. If this is not set, notifications will be skipped without error.

    ```
    # Example for a .env file (if your environment supports it)
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"
    ```

2.  **Run the Application**:
    -   Once the environment variables are set, serve the `index.html` file and its associated JavaScript modules. The application will initialize and start running the simulation.

### How to Use

1.  **Start the Engine**: Click the "AutoTrade" toggle to activate the trading engine.
2.  **Select a Mode**:
    -   **Ï†ÅÍ∑π Ìà¨Ïûê (Aggressive Mode)**: Toggling this on allows the AI to trade larger volumes and take on more risk.
    -   **Ï†ÄÏßÄÏó∞ Î™®Îìú (Low Latency Mode)**: Toggling this on instructs the AI to provide faster (though potentially less deeply reasoned) responses.
3.  **Observe**: Watch as the AI CIO analyzes the market, selects a strategy, and the trading engine executes trades based on the live data. All activities and decisions are logged in real-time and sent to Discord (if configured).
