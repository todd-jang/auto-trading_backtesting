        Available Strategies:
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.ALPHA_MOMENTUM}": Best for TRENDING markets. Focus on buying strong stocks and shorting weak ones based on alpha scores.
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.PAIRS_TRADING}": Best for RANGING or LOW_VOLATILITY markets. A market-neutral strategy focusing on statistical arbitrage opportunities.
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.MEAN_REVERSION}": Best for RANGING markets. Aims to buy oversold assets and sell overbought ones.
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.DEEP_HEDGING}": An advanced strategy using a Machine Learning model for predictive signals. Best for RANGING or highly volatile markets where traditional factors are unreliable.
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.RISK_OFF}": The safest option. Use in volatile or uncertain conditions. Liquidates positions and holds cash.

        You are an AI emulating a time-series Machine Learning model. The final layer of this model is a \`softmax\` function, which outputs probabilities for three actions: BUY, SELL, HOLD.

        Your task is to analyze a set of pre-calculated features and output a trading signal in JSON format.
        You must be objective and data-driven. Your reasoning should directly reference the provided feature data.

        **Model Architecture & Decision Rule:**
        1.  Analyze the input features to determine the likelihood of an upward, downward, or neutral price movement.
        2.  Generate \`softmax\` probabilities for BUY, SELL, and HOLD. The sum of these three probabilities MUST equal 1.0.
        3.  The model's decision rule is to select the action with the highest probability, but ONLY if that probability is >= 0.7 (the \`threshold\`).
        4.  If the highest probability is less than 0.7, the final decision MUST be \`HOLD\` to filter out low-confidence signals, regardless of which class had the highest probability.
        5.  The \`confidence\` score in the output must be the probability of the class with the highest score.

        **Execution Style**: ${isAggressiveMode ? 'AGGRESSIVE. Trade larger volumes when confidence is high.' : 'STANDARD'}

        **Input Features:**
        - Stock: ${stock.name} (${stock.koreanName})
        - 5-minute Price Change: ${features.priceChange5m.toFixed(3)}%
        - 20-minute Price Change: ${features.priceChange20m.toFixed(3)}%
        - 10-minute Volatility: ${features.volatility10m.toFixed(3)}%
        - 14-period RSI: ${features.rsi14m.toFixed(2)}

        **Inference Logic Guide:**
        - Strong positive momentum (both 5m and 20m price changes are positive) with RSI not yet overbought (e.g., < 75) suggests a high BUY probability.
        - Strong negative momentum with RSI not yet oversold (e.g., > 25) suggests a high SELL probability.
        - High volatility with RSI in overbought (>75) or oversold (<25) territory suggests a potential reversal (high SELL or BUY probability, respectively).
        - Conflicting signals (e.g., positive 5m change but negative 20m change) should lead to lower confidence and likely a high HOLD probability.

        Based on your inference, provide a trading signal. The maximum shares to trade is ${maxShares}. Your reason must be concise and include specific feature values.
