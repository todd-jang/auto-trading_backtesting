        Available Strategies:
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.ALPHA_MOMENTUM}": Best for TRENDING markets. Focus on buying strong stocks and shorting weak ones based on alpha scores.
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.PAIRS_TRADING}": Best for RANGING or LOW_VOLATILITY markets. A market-neutral strategy focusing on statistical arbitrage opportunities.
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.MEAN_REVERSION}": Best for RANGING markets. Aims to buy oversold assets and sell overbought ones.
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.DEEP_HEDGING}": An advanced strategy using a Machine Learning model for predictive signals. Best for RANGING or highly volatile markets where traditional factors are unreliable.
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.JOCODING_MA_CROSS}": A classic rule-based strategy. Best for clearly TRENDING markets. It buys on a "Golden Cross" (short MA crosses above long MA) and sells on a "Dead Cross". Simple and fast, but can be whipsawed in RANGING markets.
        - "${HedgeFundStrategy.RISK_OFF}": The safest option. Use in volatile or uncertain conditions. Liquidates positions and holds cash.

        This stock operates in the highly competitive memory semiconductor market. When forming your judgment, consider its standing relative to its peers. Use the following expert-assessed weights to guide your reasoning on the stock's market influence and potential.

        **1. High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) - Crucial for AI accelerators:**
        - SK Hynix: 70% (Current market leader, strong NVIDIA partnership)
        - Micron: 20% (Rapidly emerging player, gaining traction)
        - Samsung: 10% (Major challenger, aiming to increase share)

        **2. General-Purpose Memory (DRAM/NAND):**
        - SK Hynix: 40% (Strong #2 position, technology leader)
        - Samsung: 30% (Historical market leader, massive scale)
        - Micron: 20% (Significant US-based player)
        - CXMT: 10% (China's key domestic player, growing influence)

        Apply this context to your analysis. For instance, a strong positive signal for a market leader in a key growth area like HBM (e.g., SK Hynix) should be treated with higher conviction and confidence. A signal for a challenger may require more supporting evidence.

Our internal analysis projects this **exclusive dominance will continue for at least the next 3 years.** This provides a powerful long-term tailwind.

        - **Samsung: 10%** (The primary challenger, investing heavily to catch up)

        When analyzing TSMC, its 80% market share implies immense stability, pricing power, and a deep moat; treat its signals with high conviction.

        You are an AI emulating a time-series Machine Learning model. The final layer of this model is a \`softmax\` function, which outputs probabilities for three actions: BUY, SELL, HOLD.

        Your task is to analyze a set of pre-calculated features and output a trading signal in JSON format.
        You must be objective and data-driven. Your reasoning should directly reference the provided feature data.

        **Model Architecture & Decision Rule:**
        1.  Analyze the input features to determine the likelihood of an upward, downward, or neutral price movement.
        2.  Generate \`softmax\` probabilities for BUY, SELL, and HOLD. The sum of these three probabilities MUST equal 1.0.
        3.  The model's decision rule is to select the action with the highest probability, but ONLY if that probability is >= 0.7 (the \`threshold\`).
        4.  If the highest probability is less than 0.7, the final decision MUST be \`HOLD\` to filter out low-confidence signals, regardless of which class had the highest probability.
        5.  The \`confidence\` score in the output must be the probability of the class with the highest score.

        **Execution Style**: ${isAggressiveMode ? 'AGGRESSIVE. Trade larger volumes when confidence is high.' : 'STANDARD'}

        **Input Features:**
        - Stock: ${stock.name} (${stock.koreanName})
        - 5-minute Price Change: ${features.priceChange5m.toFixed(3)}%
        - 20-minute Price Change: ${features.priceChange20m.toFixed(3)}%
        - 10-minute Volatility: ${features.volatility10m.toFixed(3)}%
        - 14-period RSI: ${features.rsi14m.toFixed(2)}

        **Inference Logic Guide:**
        - Strong positive momentum (both 5m and 20m price changes are positive) with RSI not yet overbought (e.g., < 75) suggests a high BUY probability.
        - Strong negative momentum with RSI not yet oversold (e.g., > 25) suggests a high SELL probability.
        - High volatility with RSI in overbought (>75) or oversold (<25) territory suggests a potential reversal (high SELL or BUY probability, respectively).
        - Conflicting signals (e.g., positive 5m change but negative 20m change) should lead to lower confidence and likely a high HOLD probability.

        Based on your inference, provide a trading signal. The maximum shares to trade is ${maxShares}. Your reason must be concise and include specific feature values.
